            <h2>Hi I'm Adam!</h2>
            <div>
              <p>I am currently a Thinkful student living in Houston, Texas. While I'm excited to learn about software engineering, I wholeheartedly enjoy problem-solving and challenging myself. Upon learning more and more about coding, I often find myself looking for other ways on how I can improve my skills.</p>
              
              <p>I'm excited to work with and learn from fellow developers! If you are looking for a driven developer feel free to contact me.</p>

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>After completing my Associate's degree in Applied Science at Lone Star College, I was able to attend the University of Houston. At UH I was able to take classes for computer science and became instantly hooked on the subject. Upon taking my classes, I learned how to code in Python and C++. While going to school I also found a part-time job at Taney's Computer Services & Repair for a technician assistant position. I learned many skills there from assembling desktop computers to PC diagnostics. </p>
